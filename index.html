    <h1>The HIV/AIDS Crisis in America</h1>
    <h2>By John Bigelow</h2>
    <p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
      is one of the most prominent global health issues in recent decades. According to HIV Gov,
      “Approximately 1.2 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV today. About 14 percent of them
      (1 in 7) don’t know it and need testing. HIV continues to have a disproportionate impact on certain
      populations, particularly racial and ethnic minorities and gay and bisexual men.”
      Take a look at the chart below to observe new cases that emerged in the year 2018.</p>

      <p>Blacks/African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos are disproportionately affected by HIV. In 2018:
        Blacks/African Americans accounted for 42% of new HIV diagnoses and only 13% of the population.
        Hispanics/Latinos accounted for 27% of new HIV diagnoses and 18% of the population. The pie chart below
        explains the percentages of new HIV cases based on race in 2018.</p>

    <p>Medicine has come a long way and the next step in fighting the HIV crisis is finding a cure. As of 2019,
      "Scientists funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announce they have developed a new tool to
      measure the success of HIV cure strategies. The tool accurately and easily counts the cells that make up
      the HIV reservoir, the stubborn obstacle to an HIV cure. This advance will enable researchers who are trying
      to eliminate the HIV reservoir to clearly understand whether their strategies are working."</p>
